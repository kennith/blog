### Machine Learning Exam Prepareness

There are so many service Amazon provides. This prepareness course helps me focus on the exam requirement and area of expertises are needed to be a Machine Learning certified by AWS.

### Build an Alexa Gadget

I was really looking forward to this workshop and it did not disappointed. I learned a lot of using code to interact with GPOIO and how each device can interact with Alexa. It's fun and educational. 

### Improve logistic operation with Amazon Forecast

This is my first **Builder Session** with AWS re:Invent conference. It's fast paced and I think it helps me get started with learning about the service and getting understand the concept.
