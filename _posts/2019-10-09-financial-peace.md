I picked up this book because I heard Dave Ramsey's podcast. 

In his book, along with his style of speaking in the podcast, the topic are very straight forward and simple steps (but challenging) to follow. 

It's pretty simple, spend less than you have, save as much as you can, and invest (if you are a starter) only items that have higher chance of return. 

It's not a bad thing to bargain because you are paying for something that you think the value it should. The seller does not have to sell it to you if they don't want to.

I definitely learn a lot from this book.
