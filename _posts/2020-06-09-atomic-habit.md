I enjoy reading this book. 

This book explains how good or bad habits are form, how to build the good and eliminate the bad. 

The story about successful people hits home to me. We always hear successful people have the passion on their craft. In another way looking at this is that these successful people have a way to overcome the boredom to practice their craft everyday, even on the days that they don't feel like practicing it.

Some quotes form the book I like:

- Gene do not determine destiny, it determines area of opportunity.
- The last is always the least crowded.
- Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
