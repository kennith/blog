<p>I had an interesting conversation the other day comparing stores based on the Walmart and Mcdonald standard. The following is a comparison.</p>
<p>Walmart &lt; Target/Trader Joe&#039;s/Fresh and easy &lt; Whole Foods<br />Mcdonald &lt; Jack in the box/Wendy&#039;s &lt; In N Out/5 Guys and a burger<br />Starbucks &lt; Seattle&#039;s best/Coffee &amp; Tea&#039;s leaf &lt; Peet&#039;s coffee</p>
<p><b><u><i>The comparison is totally bias, of course.Â </i></u></b></p>
<p>On the other hand, the brand store on the left has more stores to the stores on the right, possibly more profitable as well.</p>
