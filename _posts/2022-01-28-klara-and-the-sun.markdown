This book is a page tuner. The flow of the story is so smooth just like water floating through a river.

This book is an AI telling a story of human from an AI point of view. There are some discussions to explain about the story ending. Some are permissive, but I am going to choose the optimistic side of the story.

Even if you choose to be permissive about the ending or optimistic side of the story, you won’t feel sad or happy. I think that’s the brilliance part of the author.
