<p>How do you get your team to come to you constantly and asks "what do you want me to do"? It helps by letting your staff to be able to solve the problem on their own.</p>
<p>Today, we have more workers prefer to "do whatever management tell me to do". It is because we have more managers discourage their staff to make mistakes.</p>
<p>This book use "Hotel Green Core" as the sample on how they have their employees to be fully automated and at the same time enjoy their work.</p>
<p>One of the discussion points from this book is to encourage managers observe their employee and only interfere when they see something wrong. Let staff be proud of what they do and encourage them to find solutions beyond basic guidelines.</p>
<p>I thought this book was a good read, although the company uses in this book is a hotel, I find many examples can apply to different industries. I think having a constant communications with staff is important and allow staff to make mistake is also important. I agree that the staff are the one having the first hand experience with the customers, staff are more likely know the best solutions. It is important for managers to accept that their staff might be more likely having a better solution.</p>
