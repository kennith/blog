Before I read this book, I understand it takes grit to be successful in life. However, I am not familiar with "teaching" grit to kids. (This books is not about teaching grit to kids, by the way, this just apply to the current stage of my life.)

"It was the combination of passion and perseverance that made high achievers special." Greatness is achievable and it is doable. However, it all started somewhere. The "somewhere" for kids come from play. They have to be interested in something before the hard work started. 

I learn that it is OK to not be good at something, just let them play. When the interest grows deeper, the hard work will follow. 

Then what is the balance? When to move on when interest does not become hard work?

I like the "Hard Things Rule" the author have in her family. Everyone picks something hard to learn. It is OK to quit, but it has to be after a time span, say, a year. 

We play some sport, play some musical instrument, or study a subject. We might not become the expert, but I like what the author wrote in the end of the book. 

"Define Genius, as working toward excellence."
