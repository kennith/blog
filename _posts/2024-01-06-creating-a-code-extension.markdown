It has been a while since I switch to VS Code from SublimeText.

One of the reason I am still hanging on SublimeText is because of the excellent [Jekyll package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jekyll). It just works the way I needed.

Since switching to VS Code, I have configure it so much that I am very comfortable with it. I have desire to use VS Code only, but one thing I cannot find is an extension replacement of SublimeText on VS Code. There are many Jekyll extension for VS Code, but none of them meet exactly what I need (or a clone of Jekyll in SublimeText).

I also tried using the plugin for [VIM](https://github.com/csexton/jekyll.vim), but it still does not meet what I need or I feel comfortable using.

I decided to write my own [Jekyll extension](https://github.com/kennith/jekyll-vscode) for VSCode. Right now it is pretty barebone and only cover the command I use the most, but it is a start. If I need more commands and customization, I probably can continue with what started.
