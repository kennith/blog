<p>It's that time again! It's time to giveback to the community.</p>
<p>I am offering to design and develop a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_page">landing page</a> for one for profit organization and one for non-profit organization. It includes six months of hosting on the Amazon web service.</p>
<p>You can contact me by leaving a comment below. The due date for submission is August 31, 2014.</p>
