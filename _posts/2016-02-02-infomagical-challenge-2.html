<p><a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/infomagical-challenge-2/" target="_blank">Today's challenge</a> is difficult for me.</p>
<p>The task is to clean up my phone.</p>
<p>Some of tasks I have already done prior to this challenge such as turning off notification. (partially done since I turn off social media's notification. Email is still on, but only during my active hours.)</p>
<p>The difficult part is to clean up the home screen.Â I have a brunch of apps in the home screen that I feel is necessary. Letting them go is difficult. However, I did it anyway.</p>
<p>The reason behind this challenge is to make my phone just part of a tool. The challenge is to make the phone not a task oriented device.</p>
<p>My phone home screen as of today:</p>
