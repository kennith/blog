<p>Today's <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/radio/#/ondemand/566296" target="_blank">challenge</a>Â is to have a face to face conversation instead of email, text, or IM.</p>
<p>The research shows that it takes 7 minutes to know if the conversation is interesting. As we live in a email, text, or IM world, we tend to edit a lot in our thought in order to make ourselves appear to be as perfect as we can. Comparing with a conversation, we are more authentic because it is our raw thought and emotion.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a challenge, but I am going to try.</p>
