<p>It's my second father's day.</p>
<p>My son did not make a card or paint of picture of me as a father's day gift, but yesterday in class, during music time, he took a bell from the teacher's basket after squeezing through among other bigger kids. Once he got out from the crowd, he saw another kid who was about his same age and size but was just standing there because he could not squeezed through.</p>
<p>He looked at him, without second thought, and gave the bell to him, went back to the crowd and get another one for himself.</p>
<p>His shown of character is a much better gift to me than anything else.</p>
