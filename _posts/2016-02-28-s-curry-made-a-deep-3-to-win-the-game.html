<p>This is a very exciting game.</p>
<p>The Oklahoma City Thunders started the game with more than 10 points lead, but the Golden States Warriors kept the game close that they were able to tie the game at in end of regulation when Warriors A. Iguodala made two free throws after Thunders' Kevin Durant foul with 0.7 seconds left.</p>
<p>In the over time, the Thunders continue to build the lead, but the Warrior still continue making the game close. The Thunders had one more chance but fail to make a basket to break the tie, with 6.10 seconds left, this happens:</p>
