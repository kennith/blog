<p>This is another book that I read to prepare myself for parenting. There are many good points illustrated in this book. These points might seem to be common sense, but most of us might have forgotten in our daily lives.</p>
<p>One of the common themes in this book is about education. Nowadays parents are afraid that their children "already lost at the starting line", meaning the children are behind other children. This reminds us that when we are 30s, we would not remember if we learned to read when we were 3, 4, 5, or 6. We would not remember if we start learning to speak when we were 2 or 5. The point is rather taking your children to all the alternative class, it is better to spend time with your children playing. A person is better with character, not by knowledge. A person with a lot of knowledge without character deems to fail miserably.</p>
<p>Another important point is to teach children by example. Young kids might not understand language, but they learn by example.</p>
