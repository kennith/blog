This is the type of soft topic on engineering that I enjoy reading. Software engineers read a lot of hard topic articles, blogs, and books, but Uncle Bob’s “Clean” series share the side of software engineering that happened daily in their work. It is because software engineers don’t just write code. We share responsibility with the business owner.

There are topics seemed to be obvious when you read it, but it’s not so obvious until someone wrote about it. e.g. [The Programmer’s Oath](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2015/11/18/TheProgrammersOath.html).

If you have read other “Clean” book series, this book might feel repetitive, but there are some new insights and discoveries in the book.
