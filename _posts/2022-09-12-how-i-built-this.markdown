At first, I enjoy listening to Guy Raz's How I built this podcast. Then I went deeper about this by reading his book.

I enjoyed reading the stories of founders on how they built their company. Their struggles, their perseverance through different stages, and their path to success. I like how these stories are "small" business founders because I feel that I can be more relatable to them. (not that I am a founder of sort)

Guy Raz explained some of the patterns he found from these founders success and failure. How these stories encourage those who are currently a founder and pitfall to avoid when building their company.

I recommend this book for those who are about to be a founder or just like to read about business.
