At first I was intimated by the length of the books, but it was a really a page turner. 

After finishing this book, I have broaden my view on the humanity and my perspective of the history. I am more aware of how we become who we are today and what to expect or image our future as human. 

One line really hit me is on page 331 in the chapter titled **The Capitalist Creed**. It says

> ... the craving to increase profits and production blinds people to anything that might stand in the way. When growth becomes a supreme good, unrestricted by any other ethical considerations, it can easily lead to catastrophe.

This is reflecting the industry I am in now and I am hoping that will change or catastrophe will happen.
