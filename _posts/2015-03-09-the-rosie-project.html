<p><img class=" alignleft" src="http://d28hgpri8am2if.cloudfront.net/book_images/onix/cvr9781476729091/rosie-project-9781476729091_hr.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="399" />I learned about this book through the <a href="http://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Rosie-Project">Bill Gates' reading list</a>. Since I am doing the fiction and non-fiction rotation for my reading, I picked up this book for reading pleasure.</p>
<p>The Rosie Project is a page turner. The characters in the book are fun and the pace of the book are quick.</p>
<p>There is not much I want to spill in here because it will ruin the fun for potential readers. However, if you enjoy watching the Big Bang Theory, this book is for you.</p>
