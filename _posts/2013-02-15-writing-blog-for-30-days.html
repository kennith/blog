<p><span>I stopped writing blog since I spent more time with Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. </span>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>As a result, most of my "writing" tends to be short and without spending much thought over it. </span></div>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>My writing becomes just a burst of emotion. I didn't bother to review what I wrote and I pressed on "Send" as fast as I could. </span></div>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>This has become a problem. </span></div>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>My pathology of thought became shorten and unclear. </span></div>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>I practiced less on critical thinking. </span></div>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>Photo has become an album instead of a compliment of text. </span></div>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>Starting today, I will start writing blog again. One entry a day for <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days.html" target="_blank">30 days</a>. There will be no restriction on topics. I will just write. </span></div>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>Let the writing engine starts... </span></div>
