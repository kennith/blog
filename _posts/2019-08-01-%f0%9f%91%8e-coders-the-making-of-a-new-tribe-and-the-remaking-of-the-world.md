I disagree with most of the contents in this book. 

- 10x engineer does not exist, but the author insists it does. 
- The author glorified the founding developers and diminished developers who maintain code, which I think the later is harder. 
- The author thinks coding is an ability you were born with. I strongly disagree.</li>
