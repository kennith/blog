Note on [Working with third party services in laravel
](https://laravel-news.com/working-with-third-party-services-in-laravel).

- Put 3rd party integration classes under `app/Http/Integrations`, but I will try out `aa/Integrations` first to see if makes sense to me.
- use Saloon package

I can give it a try when I have a project needs to be integrated with a 3rd party service. I think the AWS S3 service will be a good start.
