<p>This book introduces another way to validate ideas. It explained how to validate an idea with the resources that you already have in a week.</p>
<p>This book is kind of a guidebook and a storybook, to me. It includes a lot of instructions and real life exampleÂ from different Google Ventures portfolio companies. It introduces some tools to help making the sprint works.</p>
<p>I think in order to get the sprint to work, first you have to have the right people with committed attitude, second, you have someone who can take the lead to stick the sprint's plan.</p>
<p>I like the method of voting and the method of generating ideas. It keeps everyone accountable and at the same time, setup the best scenarios for success.</p>
<p>I like how the author said there is no losing because in the end, you learn something even if the prototype did not work. I would definitely give this Sprint at try with my team.</p>
