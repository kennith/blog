<p>Project management, it is an art.</p>
<p>It is a skill that requires understanding the resources you have and the goal you are trying to reach.</p>
<p>It is easier to plan a project if the resource and goal do not change from the start to the finish of the project. The world does not work like it should.</p>
<p>How do you manage when the variable of resources and goal change in the middle of the project even when you plan well?</p>
