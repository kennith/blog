I am really glad that I picked up this book. It is a very good read especially if you want to understand how mRNA vaccines came up as one of the ways to combat COVID-19. 

This book gave me just enough insight about how mRNA work (without going too deep to the point that I will not understand) and why it works so well, it also gave me more understanding, history, and appreciation of the scientists behind this discovery.
