Last year, I had the worst time with the reInvent conference even though I passed the **DevOps Professional**. 

This year was different. The conference ran more smoothly. The content hub really helped me to attend as many sessions as I could by not traveling among buildings. I could spent a day at MGM, Venetian, or Aria. 

There are a lot more attendees than last year. However, attendees this year were much more courteous this year. 

I really learned a lot.
