<p>Today I took the <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/infomagical-challenge-1/" target="_blank">Infomagical challenge #1</a>: Do one thing at a time.</p>
<p>As we all know, multi-tasking is a myth, multi-switching is the truth. I do a lot of multi-switching at work. I know it is bad, but I just did not want to delay any decision making messaging and I feel that I always need to know something right a way.</p>
<p>The podcast said that the more we switch, the more energy we spent, therefore, feel more tired.</p>
<p>Today, I took the challenge. I devoted one hour for a task without self-interference (or internal-interference).</p>
<p>The result is refreshing. I felt I have a lot more energy after work. Today is Monday, I am going to try everyday until the end of the week to give this a fair comparison. (After a weekend, one should feel more refresh.)</p>
<p>I will see.</p>
