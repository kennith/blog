<p>Today is <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/radio/#/ondemand/566294" target="_blank">infomagical challenge #</a>3.</p>
<p>This challenge hits hard on me. I am the type of person wants to know about all the things that is around me. I want to have the information as much as the person next to me. I want to know abut the topics when I am in a conversation with a group.</p>
<p>However, today's challenge is to avoid the "trending topics". I am going to challenge myself doing this.</p>
<ol>
<li>I will read information that will help me to reach my goal.</li>
<li>When I am reading about something, I know the reason behind it.</li>
<li>When someone asks me about a topic I do not know, I will just smile and say no, I don't know.</li>
<li>I will not write email/instant messages in haste.</li>
<li>I will write about the topics that I read. (I like this line from the podcast: Reading without writing is idle.)</li>
</ol>
<p>To recap what I have done so far:</p>
<p>#1: No multi-tasking. (multi-switching).</p>
<p>#2: My phone is my tool.</p>
<p>#3. Read with a purpose.</p>
