<p>I just finished watching all 13 episodes of House of Cards. I am not going to discuss about this show, which is good and I recommend it, but I want to discuss about the availability of this show.</p>
<p>House of Cards is the original TV series financed by Netflix. Netflix is a movie rental company that provide customers both DVD and streaming online.</p>
<p>Usually a TV series will show each episodes once a week. Netflix did it differently, it puts all 13 episodes available for viewing. As a Netflix subscriber, you can choose to watch it all at once, once a week, or once a day, at your own pace. This model is what this generation want. Watch it anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>I wish there will be more shows available on Netflix this way. I just like it better.</p>
