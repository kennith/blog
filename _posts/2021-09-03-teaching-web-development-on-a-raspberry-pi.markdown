title: Teaching Web Development on a Raspberry Pi

I recently bought a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. My intention to do with this device is to learn hardware development. When I was setting up this device, I downloaded [Ubuntu for Raspberry Pi](https://ubuntu.com/raspberry-pi). I also downloaded [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/raspberry-pi) to be used as an editor. 

While I was tinkering with the [breadboard](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2975), I install PHP (apt install php) just for the fun of it to see if the Raspberry Pi can handle it. It works perfectly. If it can handle backend language, then it certinaly can handle HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

So, my point of this post is, I can take this minimal setup and bring it to underprivlege communities without a $1,000 laptop. 

Let's break it down. 

| Device| Cost |
| :-- | --: |
| Raspberry Pi 4 | $ 55.00 |
| [32GB SSD](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Flash-Memory-SDSDB-032G-B35-Change/dp/B002G12OBO) | $ 8.39 |
| [20 inch Monitor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07743412C/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_XSQJ44H29YS2541F22ZK) | $ 104.97 |
| [Keyboard and Mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Desktop-Durable-Comfortable-keyboard/dp/B003NREDC8) | $ 14.99 |
| Total | $ 183.35 |

$200 is the cost to get someone started with web development. What a bargin.
