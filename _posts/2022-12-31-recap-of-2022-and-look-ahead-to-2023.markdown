## Personal Level

- I restarted my exercise routine after the pandemic year, but it has not yet reached at the same level I used to be before pandemic year. On the bright side, it is getting there. 
- Building Lego is my new found hobby in 2022.
- I learned a lot of home improvement. The things that I did definitely gave me a new perspective of fixing or building things. It is important of using the right tool for the right job. 
- I finally got more comfortable reading on Kindle.
- I switch from iOS back to Android. I tried for a year, I think I am pretty much settled as #teamandroid (still, the integration of iPhone, iPad, and MacBook is amazing)

## Professional Level

- It is a blessing to work among people who are smarter than you, it leveled me up this year. 
- It is humbling to work with people from all places around the world. It all thanks to the Internet. (and tools available to use)
- I have been using Visual Studio Code over 2 years, but I still found myself kept going back to [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (and [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)) for some tasks. 

## Looking Forward

- I miss playing sports with my friends. It is getting harder to gather a group of people to play sport, but at the same time it is so easy to gather for any event that has food involved. 
- It is great to get some win from making libraries or packages (like [packagist](https://packagist.org/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)), but I think in order to make a dent of the universe, to create a service or application can go a lot further.
