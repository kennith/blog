In 2022, letâ€™s do these.

- Exercise daily.
- Read 12 books.
- Record 12 episodes of podcast.

## Exercise
15 minutes of exercise daily

- Swimming, or
- Bike, or
- Elliptical, or
- Running

## Reading

12 books, it equals once a month. That means I am going to spend at least 30 minutes a day to read.

## Podcast

This is new. It is a way for me to improve my presentation skill and explaining things in a clear and concise way. See Eight Percent Time Podcast
