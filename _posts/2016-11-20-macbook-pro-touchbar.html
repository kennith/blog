<p>I use a Dell laptop with Windows at work, but personally I use a Macbook Pro. I write code and do productivity things on the Dell laptop with Windows at work. When I am at home, I use the Macbook to do personal stuff, play games, or write code.</p>
<p>I think I spent fairly enough time on both machine.</p>
<p>Despite my work laptop is pretty good, the Macbook is always more superior on the trackpad. It's very intuitive and very responsive.</p>
<p>Other than the trackpad, I do not find neither machine has any big difference to me because all of my work is done inside a browser, a terminal, and SublimeText. These applications are cross platform, so when I am on  either machine, it still feel the same. (I think probably if I am on a Linux machine, it will not make any difference to me neither.)</p>
<p>Lately, Apple decided to add a Touchbar to the Macbook pro. It basically took away the function keys and the Escape key.</p>
<p>It most likely don't affect the people who use the Macbook for productivity stuff, such as writing a blog or taking care of their finances, but many developers are not very happy about taking away the function keys and the <em><strong>escape</strong></em> key.</p>
<p>I spent time on Vim and I understand the importance of the escape key. The SublimeText also use the escape key too, so I get why the developers are unhappy.</p>
<p>I personally try not to use the escape key because I thought that key is out of my normal typing range.</p>
<p>I remap my Vim escape to Ctrl-c and my SublimeText escape key to Ctrl+\. It's not an usual keymap, but it works for me.</p>
<p>The reason to add a Touchbar on a "Pro" machine still confuse me, but it is OK to me because my Macbook Pro 15" 2013 is running great. If it broke down, I will probably be looking for a Chromebook or a Microsoft surface when time comes.</p>
