A day has 24 hours, commit 8 hours to sleep and 8 hours to work, the remaining 8 hours is for anything you want, supposedly.

On a non physical distancing time, most people spend 2 hours a day on commute. It leaves a person 6 hours. 2 hour for cookings and eatings. There remains 4 hour. 

I wonder, how did I spend for the 4 hours?
