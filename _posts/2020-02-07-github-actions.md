I like GitHub actions, except that I cannot test it locally the same way I can do on GitLab with `gitlab-runner`. 

I have no idea how GitHub CI, I mean Actions, runs so fast. There must be some sort of running Docker or Kubenete on cache or something. 

Anyway, as always, the interface is just very pleasant to work on, just like the core GitHub products.
