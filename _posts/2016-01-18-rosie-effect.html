<p>Rosie Effect is the second book for <a href="https://kennith.wordpress.com/2015/03/09/the-rosie-project/">Rosie Project</a>. I really liked the first book, so when Rosie Effect was released in paperback version, I immediate get it and started reading it.</p>
<p>However, it took me a while to finish this book comparing with the last.</p>
<p>The story picked up where it left off. Rosie and Don moved to New York where Rosie to continue the education and Don’s new adventure with the new position in Columbia University.</p>
<p>Don continued to be Don, but his life change when they were expecting to be parents.</p>
<p>Rosie and Don went through life just like most of us, but with Don’s “above average” personality, it created some exciting but amusing situations.</p>
<p>I thought the first half of the book was slightly hard to go through, but the second half went by really fast.</p>
<p>However, I still definitely recommend this book to read for pleasure. I still cannot get the images of Sheldon Cooper as being Don.</p>
