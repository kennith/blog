In the winter, my exercise option indoor is to run on an elliptical.

Elliptical is my least preference because I did not think it maximize the time spent on it.

I think I was doing it wrong the whole time. When I was running on an elliptical, my upper body was swaying left and right along with the strides. I did not notice it until yesterday. I started to give more control to my upper body and I immediately felt my core is doing work.

I guess I should be more mindful when I am exercising.

Exercise = Mind + Body?
