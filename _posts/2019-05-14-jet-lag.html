<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I recently traveled to Asia for vacation. It was located at a 16 hours different time zone from home base. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It was not my first time travelling to Asia and I always had a hard time adjusting to the new time zone when I was there and when I returned home. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This time, I did something different and it helped me a lot. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On the first two days upon arriving and returning, I slept whenever I felt tired. I sleet at 3pm local time and woke up at 1am local time, but it's OK. I was not forcing myself to adjust to the local time, but let my body dictate the sleeping pattern. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On the third day, things will go by easily and much easier to adjust to the local time. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It sounds like a waste of time on the first two days, but I did enjoy the rest of the trips. </p>
