<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vgdKFNo8L.jpg" alt="" width="189" height="338" />I have been reading John Grisham's legal thriller since I first encountered one of his another novel called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Runaway-Jury-Novel-John-Grisham/dp/0345531949/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419694879&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+run+away+jury">The Runaway Jury</a>. Recently I picked up this novel, The Associate, as a pleasure read.</p>
<p>The Associate told a story of a new lawyer haunted by his past mistakes, a mystery man used his past forcing him to commit illegal activities against his prestigious law firm, and throughout the whole time he was being an unhappy employee.</p>
<p>I was unsatisfied with this novel. I felt the novel was going circle the whole time until the last few chapters. The ending was disappointed too.</p>
<p>I don't recommend The Associate, but Mr. Grisham's other legal thrillersÂ are much better than this.</p>
