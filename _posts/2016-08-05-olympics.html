<p>Which country are you rooting for in the Olympics?</p>
<p>I got asked with this kind of question every time when an International event is about to happen.</p>
<p>I was born in Hong Kong, educated in the USA, and currently working at a Japanese company.</p>
<p>Which country am I rooting for?</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>I am rooting for the athletes competing in the games. When an athlete win a gold, silver, or bronze, I am celebrating for them regardless their country of origin.</p>
<p>Athletes of the Olympics, let's celebrate your hard work!</p>
