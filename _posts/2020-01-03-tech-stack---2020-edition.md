In the beginning, I was a BASIC "programmer" because I want to stop dying in [Nibble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibbles_(video_game)). 

I took a computer science in college, humble by alogrithm, math, and compile time with C++. While I was wondering if this is something I want to do, I took a web development class with `PHP`. It is the moment that I discover web is something I want to do. 

Two decades later, web development is not just `PHP` anymore. It involves a lot more. Today, it appears to involve more for making a scalable web application.

Let's take a look. 

- Laravel (Dynamic App) <3
- Bootstrap (HTML)
- SASS (CSS)
- React/Vue/jQuery (JavaScript)
- Linux (OS)
- Apache/Ngnix (Web server)
- MySQL/DynamnoDB (Database)
- AWS (CloudFormation, CDK, VPC, EC2, RDS)
- Docker (Automation)
- Virualbox/Hyper-V (Local development)
- Packer (AMI preparement)
- Test Driven Development
- YAML, JSON, CLI, etc. 

One cannot **just learn to code**, it takes commitment for life long learning.
