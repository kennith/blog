<p>I partially agree when <a href="http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/12114523/kobe-bryant-says-european-players-more-skilled-americans-blames-aau">Kobe said European players are more skillful than American players</a>. I haven't seen all European players, but the European players in the NBA are very skillful.</p>
<p>Basketball is a popular sport in the America, but we started to get players who are just more physical, but not necessary skillful. Why? I think it's because we are getting used to watching ESPN top 10 and NBA top 10. The young players growing up wants to be like those 5 second clips, they try very hard to dribble cross over someone or to dunk over someone. We tend to forget basketball is a team sports. The basketball game does not win by fooling someone off a dribble or a highlight dunk.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the type of highlight from the top 10 plays produced by the NBA on the first 4 days of the year:</p>
<p>1/1: 5 dunks<br />
1/2: 8 dunks and 2 blocks<br />
1/3: 8 dunks, 1 block, and 1 team work.<br />
1/4: 9 dunks and 1 layup.</p>
<p>In the 35 highlights (1/1 is top 5 instead of top 10),  30 dunks, 3 blocks, 1 layup, and 1 team work. (The team work highlight is from the San Antonio Spurs)</p>
<p>No wonder why we have more dunkers in the top draft than basketball players who can actually do the basketball basic: Shoot, pass, and cut.</p>
