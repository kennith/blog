<p>I have been blogging about how much I love my Fitbit ever since I got it around June. However, I don't think I can recommend this product anymore.</p>
<p>It is because this morning, my <strong>second</strong> Fitbit failed again after my morning working out routine.</p>
<p>I got my first Fitbit replaced with a speedy replacement from a friendly customer support. I was really happy with the whole experience, even with a failing device. However, after using the replacement for couple weeks, I have to go over the same process again. I just send an email to the customer service with the device log, I want to know what they found this time.</p>
<p>I am just not going to recommend Fitbit to anyone unless myÂ <strong>third</strong> Fitbit replacement will last more than 1 year.</p>
