<p>I picked up this book after reading the <a href="http://www.thesprintbook.com/" target="_blank">Sprint book</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jakek" target="_blank">Jake Knapp</a>. Knapp said in his book that Getting Things Done was one of the book for future reading, so I went ahead and starting reading Getting Things DoneÂ after finishing the Sprint book.</p>
<p>The author, David Allen, stressed that Getting Things Done (GTD) can be read as a reference book by picking topics that the reader is interested or can be read from beginning to the end. I read it from the beginning to the end and I definitely will use it as a reference book as I am implementing the GTD method for personal and professional work.</p>
<p>I hoped I read this book before I was introduced to different organization software such as Evernote, Inbox by Gmail, or Asana.</p>
<p>When I started using Evernote, Inbox by Gmail, and Asana, I had a hard time understanding how to use them. When I was going through GTD, these software started to make sense.</p>
<p>For example, every projects in your Evernote is basically a notebook. As you were doing research or receiving email, organize them into each notebook for immediate use or future reference.</p>
<p>Every incoming email is basically a to do job. In Inbox by Gmail, if the incoming email can be done in 2 minutes, do it. If not, set it to late time by snoozing it and set it at the time I felt I can do it. If it's someone else's job, forward it to the appropriate person. If the task is something I will do in the future but no time limitation, just snooze it without setting a date. It's a reference? Put it to Evernote. It's an useless email? Delete it or archive it.</p>
<p>In Asana, set the goal (or I like to call "end game") and layout the steps needed to take to accomplish them.</p>
<p>I wish I had the knowledge of GTD before I have the tools. Now the tools all make sense and I wish the GTD method will help me be a better person at time management and a team player.</p>
