<p>Doubt is a legal thriller about Caroline Auden, a computer programmer turned attorney, who fought a David versus Goliath case. The story did not have a lot of the courtroom drama, but it mostly told about the adventure of collecting evidence for the case.</p>
<p>The book read like a movie. At some point I found it was difficult to move on to the next page because the storyline was predictable to me. Â However, I often found continue reading it because some plot was fun and exciting. (Hint: The computer part)</p>
<p>Anyway, it's a good legal fiction.</p>
