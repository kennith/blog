<p><a href="http://www.cp1897.com.hk/product_info.php?BookId=9789620861871"><img class=" alignleft" src="http://www.cp1897.com.hk/bookinfo/image/450/9789620861871z.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="377" /></a>I was at the bookstore browsing books about child education and I came across this book, 陪兒子說說話 -- 爸爸一定要告訴兒子的44件事.</p>
<p>It was an interesting title because I was wondering what are the forty four things that a Dad would want to tell his son. I browsed through the first couple chapter and I decided to take this book home.</p>
<p>This book has forty four letters with topics of friendship, relationship, and life lessons. I believed most of us are familiar with these lessons.</p>
<p>I think as we are living by these standard, I need to remind myself that the children might not know about these so call standard in today's world. I bought this book home not only because I want to read the stories, I also want to have this book in my bookshelf to remind me about these lessons I need to tell to my children as they grow up.</p>
<p>This book does not try to make you cry, but it brings you joy reliving the moment that you had and looking forward the moment you will have with your young ones.</p>
