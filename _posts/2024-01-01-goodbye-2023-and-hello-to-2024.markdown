## Personal Level

- It had been a good year for routines. I have consistently exercise and read everyday. I admit on some days I did the minimum on exercise or reading, but I did it on a daily basis. It was quite an achievement. I am looking forward to continue with this routine. 

- I continued to learn and do more home improvement. I am expecting to do something even more difficult in 2024. 

- I started to do some self alone time without interfering with family schedule. I think it was good and it is something I will keep. 

- I watched quite a bit of programming personality on YouTube in 2023, I am going to scale it back in 2024. 

- Standing desk is a life improvement. 

## Professional Level

- I continue to work among people smarter than me. It is a blessing to be among them. 

- I will learn how to approach project from a product perspective. It means I want to approach it like solving a business problem. Prior to 2024, it was 90% technical thinking and 10% business thinking. I want to scale it to a 50-50 mentality. 

- I found my desk setup. It was not ultra wide screen. Surprisingly, it was a laptop stand and a vertical monitor. It just works. 

- Standing desk is a work improvement. 

## Looking Forward

- Let's build on the foundation I have so far and make it even better.
