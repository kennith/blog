My career is not in system design, but I think as a software engineer, it is good to understand about how different system is designed. 

This book covers many popular industry practices. I was pretty enlighten by the thought process of getting requirements, get buy in, and building from ground up. 

I really enjoy really this book (I am still clueless about some of the subjects). I am going to read the volume 2 and learn more about system design.
