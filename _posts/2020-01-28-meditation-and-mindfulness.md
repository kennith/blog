It is totally worth it if it takes 10 minutes a day to quiet down our mind.

In this book, it gave some example and guidance on doing meditation. It is not religion related, it is mostly about learning to quiet down our mind. 

As there are so much contents nowadays, our brain get so tired of consuming them. I left myself less time to think critically and less time to reflect about the things around me. 

Ever since I started swimming in the morning, I felt physically healthier and mindfully more clear. I think part of it is because I cannot bring any devices to the pool. I am absolutely "detach" from the digital, it is just me, water, and listening to myself (struggling) to breath. 

My problem is the length of my attention span. My mind tend to drift away from focusing on one subject. After I read the book and following the practice, I started to able to recognize when my mind started to drift so that I can pull it back to focus before it gets too far away. 

It is a good book to read.
