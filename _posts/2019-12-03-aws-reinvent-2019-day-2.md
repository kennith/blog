### Keynote

A lot of services were announced. Two things I am really interested are **Sage Maker Studio** and **Code Guru**. I am not sure how it will turn out. 

### AWS Security (SEC201)

This is a leadership Session and I think it is a pretty good session with informationt that I can bring back to my team to discuss about the security plan and implementation.

### Deep dive into AWS CDK (DOP402)

I think anytime there is a live code, it's not for me. 

### SageMaker AutoTuning (AIM361)

This is a new feature released today. In the past, a data scentist needs to tune the parameters on the training set to get an optimal result for the machine learning model. With autotuning, it automatically optimize the model and create a better result from raw training model. The [lab](https://gitlab.com/juliensimon/aim361) is open to use.
