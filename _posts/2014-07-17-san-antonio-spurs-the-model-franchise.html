<p>I really enjoy watching the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA 2013-14 season. I was really happy for them winning the NBA 2014 championship.</p>
<p>It was not because the Spurs beat the LeBron James led Miami Heat. It was because the Spurs has shown the NBA fans that basketball is still a team game.</p>
<p>The constant motion in the offense, the search from a good shot to a even better shot, the discipline, and the commitment to play off the system without ego. It made the game so beautiful to watch.</p>
<p>There is no need to rely on the buzzer beater because every shot is as good as the buzzer beater.</p>
<p>The Spurs philosophy has spread to New Orleans Pelican, Atlanta Hawks, Washington Wizard, and Phoenix Suns. I hope there is more teams adapting to this kind of system. Some says this is European style basketball, but I disagree. This is NBA basketball started by the Los Angeles Lakers' showtime era. It was passed on to Europe.</p>
<p>Now the showtime is back, except it is not only the Lakers.</p>
