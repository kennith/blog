By this time, we already knew how social media changed our lives. This book layout the facts and suggestion on how we can move forward from embracing this era.

I agreed with the author saying we are responsible to the media we consume from the social media. If we prefer one type of ideology, the social media will continue to show the type of ideology we want. It is because the social media only make profit when their users are sticking on their site. If we start to challenge ourselves to learn about the opposite of our preference, then we could possibly have a less polarize society that we know in 2020.
