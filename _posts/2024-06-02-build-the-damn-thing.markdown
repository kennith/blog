I enjoyed reading this book. It was fun to read and there is no sugar coated on any of the topic on starting a business. The target audience might differ, but if you are in the group that have no inherited wealth from previous generations, you can resonate a lot of stories from this book. 

It's encourage to know, "You got this".
