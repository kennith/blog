I enjoy this documentary. Social Media is not bad, but it has a problem. It enables us to create a comfort zone and it enables us to create a bubble for ourselves by telling ourselves that we are always right. 

In the documentary, it pointed out that groups are divided more than ever. One side does not hear from the other side anymore because the platform we use and our desire to prove ourselves "right". 

Social medias know this, but they also know this will generate more revenue for their investors. They have no incentive to change the course and I do not think they have a reason to change based on their busienss model. 

I am not claiming I am better or "woke", but by knowing why social media send me notification and recommendation, it helps me to be aware next time when I decide to scroll, click, or receive these notifications.
