I have been using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) a lot more lately. 

There are a lot of features in VS Code. It was overwhelming in the beginning because there are so much. 

After I subscribe [Learn VS Code](https://learn-vscode.com/) mailing list and follow the first couple steps, VS Code become very helpful to improve my productivity. 

## Explorer on the right

I used to wonder why putting the **Explorer** to the right because I thought code is read from left to right, so it made sense for the **Explorer** or other navigation panel to be on the left. After I move the **Explorer** to the right, I was able to focus more on the code instead of the folder trees. Since `cmd+0` goes to the explorer panel and `cmd+1` goes to the first group, it totally make sense to have the **Explorer** on the right. 

## Editor and Terminal Relationship

I used to also switch a lot between a **Terminal** and an **Editor**. There is a performance cost to have an editor with a terminal so I try to separate them. I started using the terminal in VS Code and it is just great. 

## CMD+P is great, shortcut is awesome

I also experimenting a lot on the keyboard shortcut. First of all, the `cmd+P` in VS Code is excellent. I think all the tool can run from `cmd+P`. However, it still does not beat `cmd+k cmd+e` to go the explorer or source code control panel. (Thanks to **Learn VS Code** tip). I have `cmd+k cmd+t` to open terminal and `cmd+k cmd+p` to open recent folder. 

## Opinion

Sublime Text and VIm are still part of my other workflow and tool. I am just glad I got another tool work for me.
