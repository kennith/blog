<p>After almost a year on leaving WordPress to Medium, I decided to (partially) move back to WordPress.</p>
<p>It was the one feature I cannot live without from WordPress. It was the automatically embed of book when I post the book link from Amazon.</p>
<p>As I like to blog about the book I read, I found it will be very helpful to those who landed on my book review immediately has a glimpse of the book. As of now, Medium does not has this feature.</p>
<p>As of today, I will post my book review from WordPress only. The other stuff such as programming and random thoughts, I will keep it at Medium.</p>
