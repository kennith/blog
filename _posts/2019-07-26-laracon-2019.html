<p>In Laracon, you usually get some hard technical talks and some soft talks. I recommend to check out @bobbybouwmann if you already have at least one year of Laravel experience,  @gonedark and @colindecarlo's talk if you are quite seasonal. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>The usual speakers such as <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">@adamwathan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/freekmurze">@freekmurze</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gonedark">@gonedark</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">@mijustin</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/colindecarlo">@colindecarlo</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/youyuxi">@youyuxi</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/stauffermatt">@stauffermatt</a>. </p>

<p>Of course, <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorotwell">@taylorotwell</a>'s vapor announcement was the "keynote". <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsPeWjKAUt0">Watch it</a>. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>@kthomas901 gave a talk on launching side project. She said "...wanting the security from corporate is completely OK..." and "...know when to end." are my favorite quotes. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>LiveWire created by <a href="https://twitter.com/calebporzio">@calebporzio</a> is some great stuff.</p>

<p>I also get a chance to meet my favorite podcast hosts <a href="https://twitter.com/michaeldyrynda">@michaeldyrynda</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobbennett">@JacobBennett</a>. I also get to say thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/marcelpociot">@marcelpociot</a> for helping me getting started with creating a PHP package. </p>

<p>My feeling is that @mijustin and @stauffermatt are the Laravel evangelists and they are the biggest cheerleaders of the Laravel community. I like how @mijustin just pour it out and reminded all of us that we only see a person's positive side from the Internet but they could be struggling. He was reminding us that it's OK to fail and it's OK to share about failure. @stauffermatt reminded us that what a special community @taylorotwell has started. We must cherish this magic, continue to be proud of what we do, and continue to be a <a href="https://onramp.dev/">welcoming community</a>. </p>
