It is pretty amazing to build a product that accepts payment. 

It can be done easily with Stripe and connect Stripe with Laravel Cashier.

Here are the steps that I think can get you started accepting payment in your SaaS. 

1. Have a product that people will pay to use. 
1. Setup a Stripe account.
1. Setup the products with pricing in Stripe.
1. Create a Laravel app.
1. Install cashier.
1. Create a Product table and adds the product from stripe to the table.
1. Identify the purchase flow.
1. Setup Stripe listener CLI.
1. Test with unit tests and e2e test (dusk).
1. Push code to production.
1. Get customer to sign up. 

Have the stripe listener setup is essental for development.
