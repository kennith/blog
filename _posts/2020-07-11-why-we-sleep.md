I never thought about sleep before I read this book. I thought it was just a part of life. 

After I read this book, I found sleeping is more important than I previously thought. 

I started tracking my sleep quality with Fitbit. I found that using electronic before going to bed affected my sleep. I sleep the same hours but I found I have more movement during my sleep if I use electronic than doing something analog, like reading a physical book. 

I used to think that changing the starting hour in high school was an excuse for students to sleep late. If the data present in this book remains true about teenager sleep cycle, then I am supporting to start school at a later time. 

This book gives me more insight about sleep. It helps me to make adjustments to have a better sleep, subsequently, a better life style.
