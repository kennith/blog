<p>I used to shop at Barnes and Nobles until I had more faith with online shopping with Amazon. I liked the physical touch of books and glancing atÂ the books' cover sitting on the shelf.</p>
<p>Barnes and Nobles and other bookstores are closing because Amazon or online bookstore had taken away many of its customers. It's getting harder and harder to find a bookstore. When we thought Amazon has put physical bookstore out of business, Amazon decided to start a physical bookstore itself. I was surprised by the move among with others.</p>
<p>There were only 1 Amazon bookstore in the world and it's in Seattle. Well, I was in Seattle for vacation, of course, I had to see what Amazon bookstore is all about.</p>
<p>My family was having lunch in the shopping center, I quickly ran to the bookstore to check it out. The Amazon bookstore felt just like a regular bookstore. It's sort of compact, unassuming brown color bookshelf all around the store, and a dedicated area to display different versions of its Kindles book reader, .</p>
<p>The collection are mostly popular titles, local favorites, or newly releases. There was an area for kids to play and read, just like any other B&amp;N and Borders bookstore.</p>
<p>The cost of the books are the same as the online store, which I was wondering how and why. I did not care, it sounds good to me.</p>
<p>Overall, I like this Amazon bookstore. I hope it will open at the area where there used to be a B&amp;N or Borders. (of course, I hope they leave the <a href="http://lastbookstorela.com/" target="_blank">independent bookstore</a> alone.)</p>
