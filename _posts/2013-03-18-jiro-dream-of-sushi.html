<p>If you want to learn more about this movie, just look at the review from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jiro-Dreams-of-Sushi/dp/B008ODZEQ0/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363585291&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=jiro+dreams+of+sushi" target="_blank">Amazon</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/movie?v=Mqz7RSw5030&amp;feature=mv_sr" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>The lessons I learned from watching this movie.<br />- Improve your craft everyday because there are always room to make it better.<br />- Finish what you started as if there is not alternative or safety net. <br />- Once you choose the career path, enjoy it instead of complaining about it.<br />- Love what you do and do it very well, that's the way to earn respect from customers and peers.</p>
