<p>It's that time of the year again, besides continue to spend quality time with family and be diligent at work, let's set some goal.</p>
<ol>
<li>Spiritual growth.</li>
<li>Eat healthy.</li>
<li>Commit 30 minutes of exercise (or at least the <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/projects/workouts/">7 minute workout</a>)Â daily.</li>
<li>Finish reading 5 books.</li>
<li>Learn another language.</li>
</ol>
