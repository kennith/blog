I did what I thought it was uncomfortable to do: I turned off my Email Notification and Badge on my phone.

It started as an experiement to see if I would be missing something. It turned out it has not been the case. I have not missed much. I still check my emails, but it is not the first thing in the morning anymore. I did not increase the frequency of checking my emails nor having miss out any tasks or information. This has been going on for 30 days, I think (?) it has become my routine now.

I am glad I have the luxury to do turn the notification and badge. Next, I need to work on my social media consumption habit.
