It has been a good year. I finished 19 books, deploy couple applications, more hands on project on DevOps, and contribute to the open source projects. 

I started to learn work on Machine Learning. The project that I worked on still on its early stage. I hope that through my knowledge on Machine Learning, I can help out my community. 

I went to Laravel and AWS conference, visit couple countries and went to couple different states. It is a blessing to have these opportunities to continue expanding my work knowledge and expand my horizon in the world that I live in. 

I actually almost swim every morning on the weekday. My health is significantly much better. 

I discovered the power of making a ToDo list and sticking with it. I, at least, felt that I am a lot of productive. 

Thank you, 2019.
