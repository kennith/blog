The career path of an engineer usually goes from hands on development and  be promoted to manager. The higher one goes, the less hands on one have. It seems to be a "default" path and many are happy to go along this way. 

However, this does not apply to everyone. Some engineers are just unhappy when they become a manager. Although it is expected to grow from an individual contributor to a manager, it is hard to refuse to be promoted to be a manager, it is even harder to remove oneself from "decider" to back to individual contributor. Many respect to Mitchell.
