In recent years, I started using Kindle as my primary source of reading. Occasionally, I still buy physical books. Once I finish reading a book from Kindle, I can just leave it as it is, but when I finish reading a physical book, I have to put it on a bookshelf along with other books that I read before. It started to take up space and like some people ask, why put it on a bookself?

This morning, I had a moment that encouraged me to keep those books. When I was staring at my bookself, I was looking at the side of some of the books. Suddenly, the "meomory" and lessons that I had learned from these books surface to my thought. I started to think about the topics I learned from the books and have a deeper thought about it. I did not know how much time I spent staring and having a moment with my thought on the book, but it was refreshing. 

I guess sometimes, it's still worth to keep the book (though it might collect dust), it is because the cover might serve you as an "inspiration" to trigger deep thinking.
