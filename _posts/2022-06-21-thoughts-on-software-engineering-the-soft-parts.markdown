I finished reading [Software Engineering - The Soft Parts](https://addyosmani.com/blog/software-engineering-soft-parts/) by @addyosmani. I learned many things from it. The following are my thoughts on couple points.

> Focus on the user and the rest will follow

I have been making this mistake as an engineer. As an engineer, I want to build product/service X because I know a technology. It was what I have in mind all the time when I start a solo project. On another perspective which could be more helpful, let me build a product/service that I, as a user, would use.

> T shape Engineer

That's what I want to be. Full stack devops engineer.

> Customized communication
> * When talking to a business person, talk about the business impact of what you are doing. Avoid using overly technical jargon.
> * When talking to engineering management, communicate the technical impact or challenges.
> * When talking with a decision-maker, you describe available options and their implications and risks, not the details of how the options work.
> * When providing a status update, be aware of what else has transpired and how your update is relevant to the project goals.

The above is my lifetime goal.

> Be kind and considerate

It does not hurt to be kind, but it should also be honest.

I see myself reading this article from @addyosmani annually. Thanks for pointing them out in writing.
