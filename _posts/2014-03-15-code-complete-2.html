It is a very good book to read if you are serious about software development.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It has been 10 years since this book was published. It is still applicable that choosing which programming language is an irrelevant question for software development. It is the understanding on concept of how to construct a product is more important.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Everyone can code, but can you code it right no matter what programming languages you use?</p>
