<p>This has to be one of the books that should be read for business and leadership. The title might lead you to think about the book is about using math to prove things around us, but it is actually to guide you on how to better approach on making everyday decision.</p>
<p>The author, Jordan Ellenberg, gave several stories about how we sometimes clouded our judgement from using wrong information and looking at them from a less accurate angle.</p>
<p>For example, does certain number on roulette has "higher" chances than others? How to look at the chances of winning a lottery? Why democracy works in a way that voters appeared unpredictable?</p>
<p>It was fascinating to read about how to think mathematically around us and it certainly changed my way to make decision.</p>
