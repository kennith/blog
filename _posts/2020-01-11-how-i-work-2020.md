Using AmazonBasic laptop stand to raise up the laptop. A 22-inch monitor as the main monitor and roate another 22-inch monitor for easier to read documentation. 

The first generation of Apple Keyboard and the second generation of the Apple magic trackpad. 

## Machines

I am using a 13-inch MacBook Pro with i5 and 8G ram. It's powerful enough to do my work. The alternative machine is a Dell XPS 13. Ever since I got the mac, I only turn it on once a month or whenever work is necessary.

## Editor 

![editor-image-1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/editor-image-1.png)

SublimeText is my go to text editor. I have my [own theme](https://github.com/builtbyeleven/eleven-sublime-theme) that is 99% based on Dayle Rees's [Hub Light](https://github.com/rainglow/sublime). I just "fixed" it with the syntax highlight problem. 

I started using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) because [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) works very well with it. 

## Terminal

I used [Nord Theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/) and swith to Zsh with [Oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

## Environment

I use Homestead. Docker is my alternative. 

## Notebook

I use Muji's Weekly notebook. They don't sell online in the US. (Weird)
