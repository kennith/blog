I have an opportunity to build an application using Go. 

Go is a simple to learn programming language. The code wrote and read more like spoken language. 

For example:

In go:

```go
func message(greeting string): string {
    fmt.Println(greeting)
}
```

When I read, `greeting` is the main subject and follow by descibing its attribute, such as **greeting is a string**. In a spoken language, we usually say **Ryan is a carpenter** instead of saying **A carpenter is Ryan**.

Of course, it does help personally that Go reads like PHP. 

**Package** => namespace

**Import** => use

Anyway, enjoy working on **Go**
