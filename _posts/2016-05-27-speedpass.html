<p>I like mobile payment, but not many gas stations are accepting it at the pump. When I saw <a href="https://www.exxon.com/speedpassplus" target="_blank">speedpass+</a> by Exxon Mobile, claiming that you can pay gas at the pump with your phone, and there is a gas station nearby accepting speedpass+, so I gave it a try.</p>
<p>First of all, it's not Apple or Android or Samsung Pay. It's an application that charge your credit card, although you can connect with your Apple Pay if you are using it on iOS devices.</p>
<p>Once you enter the gas station, launch the speedpass+ application, you have an option to "Pay for Fuel".</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-550" src="https://kennith.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/screenshot_20160526-154958.png?w=576" alt="Screenshot_20160526-154958" width="576" height="1024" /></p>
<p>It will ask you which pump you are at. I was at pump 7, so I choose pump 7.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-551" src="https://kennith.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/screenshot_20160526-155013.png?w=576" alt="Screenshot_20160526-155013" width="576" height="1024" /></p>
<p>There is a chance that the application does not pick up the gas station (due to GPS unavailability on the phone?), so it has a failsafe option, which is to scan the QR code on the pump.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-547" src="https://kennith.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/img_20160526_155054503.jpg?w=1024" alt="IMG_20160526_155054503" width="1024" height="576" /></p>
<p>The process was fast and easy. Once I select the pump, the payment goes through with the credit card that I registered with. The app will tell you that you have 30 seconds to start putting fuel into your car. (I missed on my first try because there was no indication on the pump that says read to pump.)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-549" src="https://kennith.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/screenshot_20160526-155030.png?w=576" alt="Screenshot_20160526-155030" width="576" height="1024" /></p>
<p>That's it. It's how easy it was. I did not have to pull out my wallet, insert the credit card, put in my zip code. Once finish, a receipt is sent to the phone.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-546" src="https://kennith.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/screenshot_20160526-155408.png?w=576" alt="Screenshot_20160526-155408" width="576" height="1024" /></p>
<p>Something I hope speedpass+ can improve on:</p>
<ol>
<li>The app is location aware so that when I pull into the gas station, the app will send a notification so I don't have to search for the app.</li>
<li>A better indication about the pump is ready to use after payment is accepted.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, I like what I can do with the speedpass+. It's a step forward.</p>
