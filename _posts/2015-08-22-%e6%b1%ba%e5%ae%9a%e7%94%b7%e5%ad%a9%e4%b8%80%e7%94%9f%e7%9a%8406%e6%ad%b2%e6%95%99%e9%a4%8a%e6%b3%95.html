<p>I, again, picked up this book because I want to prepare myself for parenthood. There is a saying that a person's personality is form by the time he/she reaches 3 years old. The title of this book says differently, it extends to 6 years old. I was intrigued so I picked it up from the bookstore to read what it has to say.</p>
<p>The lasting impression after reading this book is that boys are born more curious and adventurous and dislike to follow instructions. These characteristics makes it very hard for parents to take care of the boys when they are still young. It takes a lot of energy to prevent them from getting hurt or obey instructions. However, it is important not to suppress this characters from the boys.</p>
