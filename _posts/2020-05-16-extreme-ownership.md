**Extreme Ownership** is not only about leadership. It is about everyone owning what they are responsible for. 

Every topic is tied to a stroy the author experience in the Iraq war and a scenario in a business setting. Sometimes it is not about winning or losing, it is about being responsible for oneself and for others. 

Even if I am not in a leadership position, I am a **leader** in my own work. I am fully responsible for the outcome of my work. 

I recommend this book.
