If I am a rocket scientist, I do not need to read this book, right? :)

Anyway, I admires rocket scientist. They are solving a really hard problem. It is difficult to launch something out of space, communicate with it, land it, and bring it back. At the sametime, believing your craft that you keep some brave souls alive.

The lesson I learn is being a rocket scientist, the mindset of dealing with failure is treating it as a learing lesson.

It is easier said than done, but I will keep it in mind and make it part of my mindset.
