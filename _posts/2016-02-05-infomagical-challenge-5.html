<p>Today's <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/radio/#/ondemand/566297" target="_blank">challenge</a> is to set priority.</p>
<p>In modern days, we all have many priorities. The podcast talked about having too many priorities will actually make things stagnant. When we have too many priorities, we are running into many different directions. We only move inches to our goals because we cannot focus on finish a single goal.</p>
<p>The challenge for me is to choose less things to focus one. I have to choose carefully.</p>
<p>I like the podcaster said this: Technology is great tool, it is a great enabler to <em>something</em>.  However, if we don't know what is that <em>something</em>, what do we do with the enabler?</p>
<blockquote><p>Focus and Simplicity - Steve Jobs</p></blockquote>
<p>This is something I echoed with.</p>
