I was interested by the titles: Input and Output. I bought both books together.

The books have some solid advise and action items that reader can immediately follow. It is pragmatic. 

One thing that apply to this blog: Write a blog post / post a tweet after learning something new. It helps to enforce what a person just learned. It might also helped someone. This reminds me of this [blog post](https://medium.com/@kennith/dynamo-db-lsi-and-gsi-b685ff6e2d3) I wrote when I was studying to get the AWS DevOps Engineer certificate. I got some feedbacks that this short post helped them to understand LSI and GSI. (I was pretty happy about it because it helped me and others.)

Anyway, one item that I can immediately apply is how to write a blog post on something I learn following the Before, Discover, and To Do.

The formula is:

1. Before I read/learn about this, I was...
2. I discover about...
3. After reading/learning about this, I will do...
