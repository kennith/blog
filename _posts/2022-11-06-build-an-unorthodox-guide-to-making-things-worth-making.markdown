I enjoyed reading this book. This book covered the history of making iPod to reason of making Nest and to the adventure with Google. Every steps of the way, there is a story. Mr. Fadell wrote the history of each steps and the reasoning behind his decision. 

Sometimes, building a new product has to start with something one interested in. Some people (like me), are pretty satisfy with the items around us, but some, has the sense of improving something that they use and able to execute and build it as a new product that everyone enjoy. 

This book serves as an excellent guide on how and why build, the ups and downs one will probably endure during their journey.
