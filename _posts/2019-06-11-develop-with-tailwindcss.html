<p>TLDR; I just did a project using Tailwind CSS. It's as good as it advertised. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I came from working with Bootstrap for a long time. It has been my go to HTML/CSS framework. I can quickly build a good business looking website quickly with Bootstrap.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I just had a small project that I needed to work on. It's not difficult so I got to spend sometimes on it using Tailwind. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At first, since coming from Bootstrap, there's some initial learning curve needed to overcome with. Once I got it setup and running, I see the benefit of using a Utility First Framework approach to develop the front-end. It's quick, easy to customize, and importantly, easy to read. (We spend 10 times more to read code than writing code, maybe 20 times more to read HTML/CSS more than writing HTML/CSS code ). </p>

<p>It's good to have more tools to tackle problems and I think both Bootstrap and Tailwind are good tools to have in the toolbox. </p>
