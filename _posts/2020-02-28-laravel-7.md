Laravel 7 is almost here, after watching the Laracon Online talk, I am very excited about this release. The new features I can relate to are `HTTP Client`, `Fluent String Operations`, and `artisan test` command. There are more good stuff such as `Airlock`, `Custom eloquent casts`, and the `automatic scoping` in route model are awesome to checkout too. 

Since HTTP Client, Fluent String Operations and artisan test are the one will make positive impact to me personally immediately, I will take a look at them here first.

## HTTP Client

Up until Laravel 7, if you need to make a HTTP request programmatically, [Guzzle](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/) is the best available options. Now, Laravel provideds a minimal API wrap around Guzzle to make things easier. e.g. 

```php
Route::get('/http-client', function() {
    $response = Http::get('https://freegeoip.app/json/');
    $data = $response->json();
    echo $data['country_code']; // US
});
```

In Laravel, it even automatically detect the response as JSON. So you can just do 

```php
Route::get('/http-client', function() {
    echo Http::get('https://freegeoip.app/json/')['country_code'];
});
```

See more about [HTTP Client](https://laravel.com/docs/master/http-client). 

## Fluent Strings

The `Strings` helpers are wonderful. In Laravel 7, you can now chain it. e.g. If I want to convert `Thank you, Laravel 6` to `Hello, Laravel 7`, I can do it in single line. 

```php
// Pre Laravel 7
$string = 'Thank you, Laravel 6';
$string = Str::replaceFirst('Thank you', 'Hello', $string);
$string = Str::replaceLast('6', '7', $string);
echo $string;

$fluentString = 'Thank you, Laravel 6';
$fluentString = Str::of($fluentString)
                    ->replaceFirst('Thank you', 'Hello')
                    ->replaceLast('6', '7');
echo $fluentString;
```

## Artisan test

I ~~think~~ ~~probably~~ definitely love `artisan test`. 

I used to have an alias `p` to `vendor/bin/phpunit`. Now I will just do `artisan test` starting with Laravel 7.

![laravel-7-artisan-test]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/laravel-7-artisan-test.png)

It is just a lot cleaner.

Thank you, Taylor and the Laravel team.
