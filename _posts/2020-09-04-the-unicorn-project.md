**The Unicorn Project** told the DevOps story from developers side. The stories were inspired by real event from various company. As a software developer who has been working on DevOps in the past 3 years, I could sympathize with the characters in the stories. 

One thing I fully agree with at the end of the book is DevOps culture can grow from a non-technology company. Any company with an IT department can implement a DevOps culture. I think it is a benefit for being in an IT department inside a company because of the valuable business knowledge from the company.

A company's business success depends on the IT success, and a successful IT department depends on the business success.
