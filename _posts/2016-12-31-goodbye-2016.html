<p>Let's take a look at the goals I set for <a href="https://kennith.wordpress.com/2016/01/05/hello-2016/">2016</a>. I accomplished 4 out of 5, just like the way I did for 2015.</p>
<p>I found 2016 was a year of self improvement. I participated aÂ <a href="https://kennith.wordpress.com/2016/02/02/infomagical-challenge-1/">challenge</a>, improve my <a href="https://kennith.wordpress.com/2016/06/04/getting-things-done/">organization skill</a>, and got a better <a href="https://kennith.wordpress.com/2016/07/17/mindset/">perspective</a> with success.</p>
<p>I broke my personal record on having read 14 books. It was because I replaced reading social network or news during lunch time and before bedtime.</p>
<p>Evernote is a very good digital notebook for the Internet, but pen and paper is still the best way to capture my thought.</p>
<p>Let's carry on these habit to 2017 and onward. Thank you, 2016.</p>
