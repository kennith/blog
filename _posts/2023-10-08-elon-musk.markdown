A person who have put his mind on payment, space, car, social media, and AI. This book allowed me to get some insights about how a person who is involved and successful in so many areas work. 

Of course, like ELon Musk said himself in SNL, he is not a chill dude. 

I learned that

1. How to get things done. (Lead by example.)
2. First principle and question every requirement. 
3. The leader must make a decision quickly and decisively.
