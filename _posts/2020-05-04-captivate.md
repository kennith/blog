This book made sense to me. I enjoy reading this book and got a good start on learning how to "read" people. 

The most important of all, I started to understand more about myself. What is my strength in my personality. What got me uncomfortable and how to deal with it. 

I also love that I have a system to put my team at the best position to succeed. I definitely will use this to make a strong, diverse, and cohesive team when I need to put a team together. 

I recommend this book.
