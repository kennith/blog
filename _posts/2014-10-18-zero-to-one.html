<p>What makes a company valuable? What makes a startup make or break? What is an entrepreneur?</p>
<p>In Zero to One by Peter Thiel helps answer these questions.</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading this book. It gives a lot of example about startup and business strategies. It is inspiring for those who wants to start a company. The book gives the truth about the risk of starting a company, one may fail, but the lessons learned will be very valuable.</p>
<p>Some points in the book that I agree with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company which monopolize the market will keep saying that they are not.</li>
<li>Founders tend to have extreme personality.</li>
<li>China is probably the most definitely pessimistic place in the world today.</li>
<li>A clear vision and a great team attracts talent.</li>
<li>If you don't see any salespeople, you're the salesperson.</li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend those who are interested in starting a company, in management, or interested in reading about Silicon Valley history to read Zero to One by Peter Thiel</p>
