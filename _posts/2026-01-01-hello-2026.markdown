## Recap

Let's do a recap.

2025 was a changing year. I felt it was the conclusion of what happened in 2020 pandemic. It was a good way, I think?

Well 2025 is over, it was not the best year, but we continue to march on.

However, I felt I am more mature and discipline like how I set my goal last year. I think this is a success personally.

## 2026

This year is going to be different from the past 5 years. I am going to set some goals after getting a feel of how this year goes. I am going to revisit in Feburary.

However, some goals I want to continue.

-   Read 10 books.
-   Exercise daily.
-   Writing weekly.

Adding on another one: public speaking. (can I be a conference speaker? It might take 2 years, but at least get it started today.)
