I really enjoy reading this book. It gave me more information about the open source history, its philosophy, and its current progress.

I think it is helpful for anyone who uses any open source project, attempt to work on an open source project, or just discuss or contribute in a open source project to read this book. It helps to have empathy towards the people behind the open source projects and the open source community.
