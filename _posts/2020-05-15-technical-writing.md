A good software comes with a good documentation. 

I finished reading the [Technical Writing](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/overview) course to improve my technical writing. I did not know using `active voice`, starts `verb` in each bullet point, and using `terms` consistently are so important in technical writing.

I revised few of my old documentation by following the [Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style). It made a lot of improvement. 

It is diffcult for a small team to start a style guide. If you are looking for one, [Google](https://developers.google.com/style) and [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) style guide are a good starting point.
